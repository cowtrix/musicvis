# musicvis

This project is a collection of tools and creations for realtime music visualisation. This was created for live performance and various festivals and parties.

Much of the hard work was done by the amazing Keijiro (https://github.com/keijiro/), and I owe them a lot of credit. Thanks!

Everything is public domain. Go nuts - and send me some photos if you use it at a party!
